This is one of my personal backend development projects built using C# and ASP.NET Core, designed to demonstrate the implementation of a robust and scalable RESTful API. The application follows clean architecture principles and utilizes Entity Framework Core in combination with the Fluent API for precise and maintainable database configuration. SQL Server serves as the underlying relational database for managing application data.

To ensure secure and role-based access control, I integrated ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and authorization. This includes support for account registration and login functionalities, password hashing, and role management. In addition, the project implements JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, which provides a stateless, token-based security model. Users are issued tokens upon successful login, enabling secure communication between client and server. The system supports two roles out-of-the-box: User and Admin, each with different levels of access and permissions.

This project not only strengthens my understanding of API development and security best practices but also serves as a practical example of building a modern web backend with production-ready technologies in the .NET ecosystem.
